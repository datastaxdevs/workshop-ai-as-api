### Learn to build your own NLP text classifier and expose it as an API using the following technologies:

<img src="images/workshop-cover.png?raw=true" width="350" align="right" />

- AI-based text analysis with Tensorflow/Keras;
- Astra DB, a Database-as-a-Service built on Apache CassandraÂ®;
- FastAPI, the high-performance Python framework for creating APIs;
- Many useful Python libraries and packages including `pandas`, `pydantic`, `dotenv`, `sklearn`, `uvicorn`, and more.

### During this hands-on workshop, you will:

- prepare the labeled dataset for model training;
- train the model to classify any input text;
- export the trained model and test it interactively;
- create your free NoSQL database for data storage;
- set up and start an API exposing the classifier as a reusable class;
- learn how to speed up the API with DB-based caching;
- inspect how a streaming response is handled in the API.

#### Prerequisites:

- Familiarity with Python;
- A Github account is required for the hands-on.
